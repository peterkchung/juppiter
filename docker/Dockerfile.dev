# About: Development container for juppiter.
# Builds a ROS 2 Kilted environment with all dependencies for the
# perception pipeline. This same base will later be adapted for
# ARM64 deployment on Raspberry Pi 5.
#
# STATUS: Placeholder — not yet functional.

# --- Base image ---
# ros:kilted-desktop includes RViz2 and rqt for visualization.
# For Pi 5 deployment we'll switch to ros:kilted-ros-base (smaller, no GUI).
#
# FROM ros:kilted-desktop

# --- System dependencies ---
# C++ libraries required by ORB-SLAM3 and the perception pipeline.
#
# RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
#     libpangolin-dev \
#     libeigen3-dev \
#     libopencv-dev \
#     libg2o-dev \
#     librealsense2-dev \
#     cmake \
#     build-essential \
#     git \
#     && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# --- Workspace ---
# ROS 2 convention: /ws as workspace root, source packages in /ws/src.
#
# WORKDIR /ws
# COPY src/ /ws/src/
# RUN . /opt/ros/kilted/setup.sh && colcon build --symlink-install

# --- Entrypoint ---
# Source the workspace so all packages are available on shell entry.
#
# ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash", "-c", "source /ws/install/setup.bash && exec bash"]
